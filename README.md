# Know The Network
#### This is an app that will give you the ability to search a tv show that you watch and display what network/app it is available on. Examples: Netflix, CBS, The CW. 
#### A watchlist page of shows that you want to watch
#### A favorite page where the user can add their favorite shows and leave a review of them and a brief description

## Motivation
I wanted to create this app because when I cancelled cable I wanted to know what streaming apps I needed to subscribe to in order to watch my shows. I got tired of having to google each one and try to find the answer. I created this app to make that process easier and more!
